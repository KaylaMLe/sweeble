# Complex Edit Suggestions Improvements

## Overview

The complex edit suggestion system has been significantly improved to handle multiple changes simultaneously and provide more accurate suggestions.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Increased Token Limit**

- **Before**: `maxTokens = 200` (too small for complex JSON responses)
- **After**: `maxTokens = 500` (enough for complete JSON responses)
- **Result**: AI responses are no longer truncated, ensuring valid JSON

### 2. **Enhanced Prompt Engineering**

- Added specific examples for Java type handling
- Improved guidelines for type matching
- Added warnings about not changing field types unnecessarily
- Better context about method return types

### 3. **Multiple Changes Support**

- AI can now suggest multiple related changes in a single suggestion
- System shows a summary of changes when multiple are available
- Created `CodeChangeApplicationService` for applying multiple changes

### 4. **Better Error Handling**

- Detects truncated responses due to token limits
- Improved JSON parsing with fallback mechanisms
- Better logging for debugging

## Expected Behavior

### For the HelloWorld.java example:

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    private String foo;
    private String bar;

    public HelloWorld(String foo, int bar) {  // ← Cursor here
        this.foo = foo;
        this.bar = bar;
    }

    public int addFooBar() {
        return foo + bar;  // ← This should be fixed too
    }
}
```

### Expected AI Suggestions:

1. **Fix constructor parameter type mismatch**:
   - Change `int bar` to `String bar` (since field is `String bar`)
2. **Fix method return type issue**:
   - Change `foo + bar` to `Integer.parseInt(foo) + Integer.parseInt(bar)`
   - OR change method return type to `String` and use `foo + bar`

### Display Behavior:

- **Single change**: Shows the actual text to be inserted/replaced
- **Multiple changes**: Shows summary like `" // Apply 2 changes: Fix constructor parameter types and method logic"`

## Technical Details

### CodeChangeApplicationService

- Handles applying multiple changes simultaneously
- Sorts changes by offset to maintain correct positioning
- Provides preview functionality
- Uses IntelliJ's `WriteCommandAction` for thread safety

### Improved Prompt Structure

- More specific examples for common Java issues
- Better guidance on type matching
- Clearer instructions about when to suggest changes

### Error Detection

- Checks for `"finish_reason": "length"` in responses
- Warns when responses are truncated
- Suggests increasing max_tokens when needed

## Testing

The system should now:

1. Generate complete, valid JSON responses
2. Suggest correct type fixes
3. Handle multiple related changes
4. Show meaningful summaries for complex edits
5. Apply all changes when a suggestion is accepted

## Future Enhancements

- Custom inline completion elements that can apply multiple changes
- Better integration with IntelliJ's refactoring tools
- Support for more complex refactoring patterns
